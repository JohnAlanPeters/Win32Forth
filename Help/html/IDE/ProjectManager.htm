<h1>Project Manager</h1>

<br>


<p>The Project Manager helps managing the files associated with a Forth project.
It allows files associated with an application to be easily transferred to other
disk media as a standard zip file or by simply copying the files.</p>

<p>You may open a project from the IDE with the Project Manager Toolbar or menu
option (see lower). You can also open Project Manager with a previously saved
project (.fpj) file by double clicking it if the file association has been set
up.</p>



<h3>Project Manager tab</h3>

<p>Click on the Project Manager tab. The following is a screenshot of an opened
project.</p>

<center><img src="ProjectTab.gif" alt="" border="0"></center><br><br>

<p>The name of the opened project is displayed at the root of the project tree.</p>

<p>Files for an application are divided into the six categories shown :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modules - Forth .f files </li>
  <li>Forms - Form files, *.frm </li>
  <li>DLLs - any Dlls needed </li>
  <li>Resources - bitmap or icon files </li>
  <li>Docs - .htm and .txt files. </li>
  <li>Auxiliary - any other files </li>
</ul>

<p>If any category contain files then clicking on that category name will
expand the item and show the files. Clicking on a selected file will open it
in the editor for editing or browsing.</p>

<p>The path name for a selected file is not shown in the treeview, however the
full pathname is stored in the project manager. Note too that even if more than
one file references or includes the same file only one copy is saved in the
tree.</p>



<h3>Project Toolbar & Menu</h3>

<p>The Project toolbar <img src="Project Toolbar.gif"  alt="" border="0">and menu
allow access to other Project Manager functions. For the toolbar hovering the
mouse over a button will pop up a tooltip indicating the button's function.</p>

The menu options are aas follows :

<ul>
  <li><b>New</b> - start a new project.</li>
  
  <li><b>Close</b> - close the current project.</li>

  <li><b>Open</b> - open a previously saved project. The name of the opened project

  file.</li>

  <li><b>Save As</b> - save a copy of the project.</li>

  <li><b>Rename</b> - rename current project i.e the root name.</li>

  <li><b>Build</b> - build project. The build file would be the main file of the
  project. Scans the build file for needs, include and fload statements and
  add specified files. Recurses found files. Note that the build file is
  highlighted with a red icon in the project tree.</li>

  <li><b>ReBuild</b> - Same as build except any files currently in the project
  are deleted first.</li>

  <li><b>Set search path for build</b> - set the path to search for files with option
  to save to disk.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Compiling a project</h3>

<p>If the option "Always compile main Project file" (from the Options Menu)
is checked then the opened project will be compiled when "Compile" is selected
from the menu or toolbar. If not checked then if the file in the active window
is a source file it will be compiled.</p>
