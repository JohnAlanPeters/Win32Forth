Notes for Updating:

1.Change the version number in src\kernel\version.f
2 Make a new kernel and extend it with setup.exe
3.Load Win32ForthInstaller.f in the IDE and compile it
4.In the Win32Forth directory will be a new program
  called w32fNNNNN.exe containing the installer and the needed compressed files.

When the reserved space to contain the compressed files is too small,
there will be a an error.
Then look how big the file Win32Forth.dat is in the Win32Forth directory. 
Make a new Win32Forth with setup.exe and use Option M to increase 
the Application space. 
The space that Win32Forth needs can be seen with .free

The definition exclude? in lz77files.f contains a list of files that 
are excluded from installation files
