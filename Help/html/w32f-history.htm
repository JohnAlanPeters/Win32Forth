<h1>The History of Win32Forth</h1>

<h2>History </h2>

<p><i>[ Which is maintained as
a historical curiosity; please see the rest of the doc for how it really is
now. Original by Tom Zimmer ]</i></p>

<p>Andrew McKewan initially
wrote the kernel for Win32Forth (mid 1994) in assembly language as a personal
experiment in the process of bringing up a Forth under Microsoft WindowsNT.
Win32Forth uses a (relatively) small wrapper or loader written in 'C' that
loads the Forth image file and executes it. The wrapper provides some limited
console I/O to support program development. Andrew also ported (re-wrote
actually) the NEON OOP (Object Oriented Programming) support to simplify the
interface to the windows operating system calls. </p>

<p>In late 1994, Andrew's
&quot;baby&quot; kernel was turned over to me (Tom Zimmer) for possible use in
porting a large data processing application from DOS into the WindowsNT
environment. We had looked at and purchased what seemed the only available
commercial Forth system at the time, but unfortunately it was not yet mature
enough to handle our task or needs. I ported most of the tools and utilities
from my public domain F-PC Forth system to Win32Forth to make the application
porting task easier. </p>

<p>The Win32Forth system,
derived from Andrew's personal work, and the public domain F-PC, has remained
in the public domain Jim Schneider wrote the 486 prefix assembler for
Win32Forth, included under the GNU public license. This is the only part of
Win32Forth that is not truly public domain. Please read Jim's documents for
details of its use in commercial applications: <a href="w32f-486asm.htm">
w32f-486asm.htm</a>. </p>

<p>In early 1995, Robert Smith
wrote the floating point support for Win32Forth. Robert is very experienced
with such tasks, having written several floating point packages in the past,
including two for F-PC. The floating point package includes support for both
the eight byte and the ten byte floating point formats. Win32Forth took a side
road into the area of using only absolute addresses during 1995, but many
problems with compatibility with Windows95 and Win32s led me to return to
relative addressing as a much more portable solution. </p>

<p>In January 1996, Andrew
completed the &quot;F83&quot; style meta-compiler and forth source kernel for
Win32Forth. This opened the door to further kernel development, including
separated heads, and dual dictionaries. Version 3.1 released in March 1996,
Includes 'Ctrl+F1' help on the ANS Forth words described in the DPANS94
document while in the WinView [now WinEd] editor. I hypertext compiled the
DPANS94 without making any changes to the document by extending the hypertext
compiler to recognize additional search word context. This version also has
much better compatibility with Win32s running under OS/2 and Windows 3.1, due
to corrections made to the memory management code in the wrapper. </p>

<p>In May 1996, the source
level debugger interface to the WinView editor was completed. It is now
possible to debug a Win32Forth application remotely, including; setting
breakpoints, single step execution, and parameter monitoring. The requirement
to be able to perform these operations is that the application be created with
the &quot;APPLICATION&quot; program save facility rather than the
&quot;TURNKEY&quot; facility so that the programs symbols are still available
for remote debugger control. </p>

<p>July 1996, Enhancements to
windows to allow them to each have their own menus, and enhancements to objects
to allow the use of a dotted notation to access local data within an object. An
updated version of Jim Schneider's assembler has also been included with this
release. Compatibility with Win32s under Windows 3.1 and OS/2 has been
retained, but you should be warned that Microsoft has stopped supporting Win32s
in their latest version (4.2) of Visual C++. Future versions of Win32Forth may
not be compatible with Win32s. I believe the hand writing is on the wall. It is
time to start moving off of Windows 3.1 and onto Windows95 or WindowsNT. I
don't know what you users of OS/2 will do. If IBM doesn't support the Win32 API
directly, then you will soon lose access to programs developed for Windows95
and WindowsNT. </p>

<p><i>[ In fact, OS/2 died,
and Win32Forth no longer supports Win32s. It does support
Windows95/98/ME/NT3.51/NT4/2000 and XP, although some of the support for
Windows 95 and NT is academic; there appear to be no users currently to let us
test it ]</i></p>

<p>Version 3.2 released July
1996, included enhancements to Windows support including separate menus for
each application window. Added documentation (in the file Win32For.PRV) on how
to create a DLL with Win32Forth. Added an Optimizer (in the form of OPTIMIZE.F)
to Win32Forth that allows code sections to be compiled to assembly language to
improve performance. Fixed various minor bugs in floating point number support.
Added data structure support (in the form of RECORD:) for use inside classes. Added
dotted notation support to classes and sub objects. </p>

<p>Version 3.3 Released
October 1996, includes a new Font class, making font manipulation in an
application more manageable. I have started adding HTML support to WinView, so
it may eventually be used for documentation. Bill Muench donated multi-tasking
support. Additional changes were made to enahnce ANS compatibility. Andrew
donated a DLL that allowed the removal of over 2000 Windows constants. The DLL
is linked into NUMBER, so it can be used to lookup over 8000 Windows constants
without them having to be in the Forth dictionary. Extensive documentation has
been added to FSAVE, TURNKEY and APPLICATION, the words used to create
programs. </p>

<p>Version 3.5 Released mid
1997, is primarily a bug fix release, but several enhancements to the WinView
editor, now allow it to edit multiple files in memory at the same time (you
need more memory), and I have fixed the screen update code, to improve the
redisplay performance, which several people complained about. </p>

<p>During most of 1997, and
the first half of 1998, Win32Forth took a jaunt into the world of commercial
Forth systems. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, depending on how you look
at it, Win32Forth proved to be too large and complex for the commercial vendor to
use and document. In mid 1998, Win32Forth was restored to myself, and it has
enjoyed further, though limited development since that time. </p>

<p><i>[ Addendum: Tom Zimmer
quit maintaining Win32Forth and it led a secret life for several years going
through permutations as versions 4 and 5. After some time and through the
persistence and endurance of John Peters and a small group of die-hards,
Win32Forth evolved into a separate-directory system (by Rainbow Sally) which
offered promise of being a cleaner more friendly environment for beginners and
developers with some primitive batch file tools for developers to share/test
and modify their systems efficiently. Simultaneously and independently Alex
McDonald had been working on removing the C wrapper from the kernel (as sort of
a hobby) which is necessary to take total control of the Meta Compile process
to Forth itself in the outstanding tradition of Laxen and Perry, and which will
allow compilation of stand- alone executable Windows applications. With the
continued support of Dirk Busch, Ezra Boyce, George Hubert and others, and a
splendid CVS provided by Ron Aaron, Alex McDonald has taken up the
responsibility of maintaining, coordinating and generally irritating other
members of the group. ]</i></p>
