<h1>HELP
</h1><h3><i>Version 1.0
</i></h3><p>2008/04/15 By Camille Doiteau <br />
Todo: see Help\HelpBugFix.txt
</p><h3><i>Abstract
</i></h3><p>This is the help system you are currently using. It includes html documentation and
fast access to thousands of win32forth words, with either displaying a quick info
about each word or viewing its source file.
</p><h2>How to use the help ?
</h2><p>Simply read the &quot;help on Help&quot; ! <br />
(This document describes how to <b>maintain</b> the help system and database).
</p><h2>Notation convention for enhancing help quick info
</h2><p>The quick info used by this help system is parsed from the sources : for each
word definition, all the subsequent comments are gathered as the quick info.
To get the best result, Win32Forth developpers are encouraged to follow this
convention : on a first line, you put the word definition, its stack effect,
maybe with locals, and the beginning of comments. Comments can continue on
any number of following lines (maximum 8K). The only comment words allowed
are : <code>(...) { ... }</code> and <code>\</code>&nbsp;they may include Dexh commands. Example :
</p><pre>: AWORD &nbsp;( n1 -- n2 ) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ what does this word, in short
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ n1 / local1 -- n2 } &nbsp;\ a locals stack effect
\&nbsp;*G This is a Dexh auto-documentation glossary entry, explaining what the word does.
\&nbsp;It could be a simple comment too.
</pre><p>The comments scan will stop as soon as any Forth word is encountered. For the
case where comments unrelated to the word immediately follow the end of its comments,
you can insert the Forth word <code>NOOP</code> to force scanning to stop.
</p><h2>Compiling the help program
</h2><p>Compile <b>Help\HelpMain.f</b> to create Help.exe.
</p><p>Help.exe need not be recompiled when the help database is rebuilt. However,
the help database must exist before Help.exe can be run. This database comes
ready with the Win32Forth distribution but you may modify it if needed. The
following explains how to do it.
</p><h2>What is the help database ?
</h2><p>The help database is made of 2 main parts: <br />
</p><ul><li>the html help pages<br />
</li><li>the words database (words' index and quickinfo)
</li></ul><h2>Expanding the html help database
</h2><p>The html help database is made of 3 parts: <br />
</p><ul><li>a set of hand-written html pages (names beginning with &quot;<b>w32f-</b>&quot;)<br /> plus htm
files in the help\html subdirs forthform, dpans and guides
</li><li>a set of dexh-generated help pages (names beginning with &quot;<b>dexh-</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>class-</b>&quot;)<br />
(please have a look at the dexh documentation next to this page)
</li><li>a help summary, describing, for each html page, its hierarchy and link.
</li></ul><h3>Maintaining the hand-written help pages :
</h3><p>Theese are basic-html pages. We suggest you use a simple text editor to edit
them as some html editors add a lot of useless styling code (eg, never
use Microsoft Words).
</p><p>To create a new help page from scratch :<br />
</p><ul><li>Use the file <b>help\html\anew-w32f.htm</b> as a template (make a copy and rename
it). It contains all you need to create a win32Forth help page. Moreover, it
follows the general win32Forth presentation rules (thanks to the CSS style
sheet help\html\style.css).
</li><li>Insert the newly created page in the help summary (see below)
</li></ul><h3>Maintaining the dexh help pages :
</h3><p>As this documentation is written inside source files, just edit them to update
their dexh contents.
</p><p>If you want to document a new file, then there is a little more to do :
</p><ul><li>Check that your dexh code is ok by running <code>DEXF</code> as standalone and looking at the result.
</li><li>Edit the file <b>Help\HelpCreateDexhDocs.f</b> to add your file in the list of
files whose dexh documentation must be generated and run it.
</li><li>Insert the newly created page in the help summary (see below)
</li></ul><h3>Maintaining the html help summary :
</h3><p>The file <b>help\hdb\HelpSummary.tv</b> contains all the information about html pages
organization and links, in a treeview-like structure.
HelpSummary.tv contains comments explaining how to fill it. To modify or add a
new help page, follow this procedure :
</p><ul><li>Make a backup copy of the file help\hdb\HelpSummary.tv
</li><li>Open it with the IDE (use: files all *.*) and search the right place to insert
your page (ie your line in HelpSummary.tv).
</li><li>Edit the line to give it a treeview depth, a treeview name and the link to your
html page. (*** check syntax ! *** especially for character &quot;|&quot; )
</li><li>Save HelpSummary.tv
</li><li>Relaunch Help.exe, so that it uses this new version
</li></ul><p>The tool <b>Help\HelpTestTV.f</b> allows you to test HelpSummary.tv before launching the
help itself.
</p><h2>Configurating and building the words help database
</h2><p>The words help database is built in two steps :
</p><ul><li>Select all the words to be included to the word database :<br />
Edit the file <b>Help\HelpScope.f</b> in order to select sources files and vocabularies
whoose words must be included in the words'index. (Browse HelpScope.f for details).
You should run HelpScope.f as a stand alone until everything goes well.
</li><li>Once this is ok, run <b>Help\HelpBuildhdb.f</b> to actually create the words database.
</li></ul><p>As building the words database needs loading and parsing a great number of files, it
is a somewhat risky process. Always make a backup of HelpScope.f before.
</p><h3>Caution
</h3><p>A great deal of files are used by Help.exe to run. Don't modify the directory
layout of the Help directory. Some files are pre-built and needed, even for the
databases building, they are :
</p><ul><li>help\hdb\HelpFct.txt
</li><li>help\hdb\HelpSummary.tv
</li><li>help\hdb\HelpAns.txt
</li><li>help\hdb\Help.cfg
</li><li>help\html\style.css
</li><li>all the w32f-???.htm files and help\html subdirs forthform, dpans and guides
</li></ul><hr>Document : Dexh-HelpMain.htm -- 2008/04/15 -- Camille Doiteau
