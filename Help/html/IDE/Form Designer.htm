<h1>Form Designer</h1>

<br><br>

<p>Form Designer, as its name suggest, is a tool for designing forms in the IDE.</p>

<p>Form Designer is based on the stand-alone ForthForm application
<IMG SRC="Forthform.gif" NAME="Graphic1" >.
All the functionality of ForthForm is included in Form Designer.</p>

<br>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Win32Forth has no Windows Resources Editor. Instead it has Form Designer which
can be thought as a code generator. It allows interactive design of frame windows,
child windows and dialog boxes and pre-generates the code compatible with the
Win32Forth Windows class library. Forms can be saved and used under different
formats : the source version (files *.frm), once edited, cannot be reused by
Form Designer but the form-format version (files *.ff) can be updated without
changing already existing code calling the form (excepted, of course, for the
handling of new controls that might have been added).</p>

<p>Moreover, code for handling controls of a form can be added at design time.</p>

<p>Due to the way Windows classes work in Win32Forth, other Windows goodies
like menus, toolbars, property sheets and splitter windows are not part of
a frame window : they are extra objects that are linked to or used by the
main window. Hence, Form Designer offers some options to create them as
separate objects that you may then link to your windows.</p>

<p>The result is a tool allowing for interactive design without the use of
Windows Resources.</p>




<h3>The Form Designer tab</h3>

<p>The Form Designer window is displayed by clicking on the Form designer tab in
the IDE TabWindow.</p>

<p> The top window in the Form Designer tab contains the form toolbar. Many of
the toolbar buttons are enabled or disabled depending on whether a form is opened
and it contains any controls. However, hovering the mouse cursor over a button
will pop up a tooltip identifying the function of the button.</p>

<p>The bottom window contains three tabs. Clicking the "Status" tab displays
information about the currently selected form and any control selected. It also
displays a "monitor" window which allows the setting of the runtime position of
a form on the display monitor.</p>

<p>The "Properties" tab allows the selection of the dialogs for Form, Control and Action properties.
</p>

<p>The Code Editor tab displays the dialog window that allows <A HREF="Code Window.htm">adding code at design time</A>
to a form.</p>

<p>The Forms Designer tab can be detached into a floating window. This is done by
selecting the "Float Form Designer Window" option from the IDE Preferences dialog.
</A> When detached, newly created forms will be positioned relative to the
location of the detached window. Thus, if using dual monitors, created forms will
be displayed on the same monitor as the Form Designer window.</P>
