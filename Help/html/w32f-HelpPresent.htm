<h1>Help system presentation</h1>
<h2>This help</h2>

<p>This help contains two parts:</p>

<p>The first, classical one,
is a help summary treeview where you can browse help pages. There is not much
to say about this part except that :</p>

<ul>
 <li>There are sometimes navigation buttons
     inside some of these pages but it general, you can go to the next or
     previous page in the documentation with the <img border=0 width=16 height=18
     src="../Res/HLeftHtml.bmp"> and <img border=0 width=16 height=18
      src="../Res/HRightHtml.bmp"> tools and go back to the previously
     displayed page with the <img border=0 width=16 height=18
     src="../Res/HPrevHtml.bmp"> tool (use this one to come back from a page itself
     containing sub-links)</li>
 <li>a <img border=0 width=16 height=18
       src="../Res/HHelpGreyed.bmp"> greyed
     help page icon means that the help topic is not yet available. A dummy
     help page will be displayed. </li>
 <li><img border=0 width=16 height=18
      src="../Res/Hwww.bmp"> icon
     means an external link that will take you to the wordlwide web (needs an
     internet connection) </li>
</ul>

<p>The second part is a
glossary for thousands of Win32Forth words. The glossary is presented in two
ways : </p>

<ul>
 <li>In a treeview where you can find words
     sorted in different ways. Selecting a word displays a quick info in the
     upper right pane</li>
 <li>In an edit box plus a list box. You can
     select the edit box and enter keystrokes, the list will scroll to the
     first match. Then you can select in the list the word you are looking for.
     A quick info will be displayed in the upper right pane too.</li>
 <li>In both cases, when a word is selected (ie
     its quick info displayed), you can view its source by clicking the <img
     border=0 width=16 height=18 src="../Res/HSource.bmp"> tool</li>
</ul>

<p>The words treeview
presentation is particularly suitable for searching classes and methods
information and organization. The Classes branch offers a top down view of the
hierarchy of all the classes (in the order they were created). For each class,
a list of its methods is given. Remember that for a given class, all the parent
class methods are valid too so you may want to explore the parent's methods
too. The Methods branch displays, for each method, all the classes where this
method is defined.</p>

<p>Searching the treeview for
a given word can be lengthy anyway. The simplest and fastest way to obtain help
about a given word is to use the Edit and List boxes. When the same word
appears several times, you will have extra info (such as the vocabulary in
which it was defined or the class to which a method belongs) in the quick info
window to quickly select in this list the exact word you are looking for.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>With the <img border=0 width=16 height=18
 src="../Res/HCopy.bmp"> tool you can copy text from the view-source
window. Then you can paste it in your application or directly in the console to
run it.</p>

<p>If you get an
&quot;undefined&quot; message when using a word that you found in the help, it
is likely that it was defined in a library source. The library sources are not
resident in the Win32Forth system, they must be explicitly loaded before use. Check
the quick info to know in what source file this word was defined (say
&quot;afile.f&quot;) and add at the beginning of your source the directive
:<code> REQUIRE afile.f</code></p>

<p>You can look at the <code>DEFER</code>ed words contents by typing, in the
Console, <code>SEE adefer</code> .
