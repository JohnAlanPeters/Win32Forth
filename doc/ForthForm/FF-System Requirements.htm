<P ALIGN=LEFT>ForthForm has been tested on Windows 98/ME/2K/XP but should run on any OS that Win32Forth runs on.</P>
Since version 2 ForthForm has been included with Win32Forth releases. As such all required files are included with
each distribution.<br> Included would be the Html help files and any Dlls necessary for proper operation.<br>
Source files are also included so that you can modify the system (if you want to )
and then recompile it from scratch. Use the setup file included with the Win32Forth distribution
to recompile.<br>

<p>Note these optional files:<br>
<b>ForthForm.cfg</b>           - configuration file, easily created containing commands for
                          configuring ForthForm. Commands include,<br>
                        * SetBackGroundImage &lt;filename&gt;  \ change wallpaper if supported<br>
                        * BLACK to BackGroundColor  \ change background color<br>
                        Any other Forth commands, e.g. set the name of the editor<br>
<b>FreeImage.dll</b>           - required dll for image support. Can be obtained from <A HREF="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/">here</A> or it is included with
