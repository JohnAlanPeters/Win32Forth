<h1>Rebuild Win32Forth</h2>

<p>Note : <i>rebuilding Win32Forth is not the same as installing it. The .exe programs
to either install or rebuild Win32Forth are different.</i></p>

<p>You can rebuid Win32Forth with the Setup.exe program. The rebuild is done from the
kernel and the file extend.f which includes a number of extensions and tools.</p>

<p>You can use several options when doing this (mainly to rebuild parts of Win32Forth).
One of theese options is used to adjust the dictionary size :</p>


<h2>Adjusting the Win32Forth dictionary sizes</h2>


<p>To increase the amount of
dictionary space available for our application, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit Win32Forth before proceeding.<br><br>
      Win32Forth must be terminated, so the modified dictionary version can be
      written to disk with the same name.<br><br>
      You can leave this window open for reference if you have at least 8 megabytes
      of ram, though it may cause the following steps to take somewhat longer to complete.<br><br></li>

<li>Double click &quot;Setup.exe&quot;. This will start the Win32Forth Setup<br><br></li>

<li>Choose &quot;M&quot; (Meta compile a new Kernel)<br><br>
    This will begin the process of rebuilding the complete Win32Forth system with the
    adjusted dictionary sizes.<br><br></li>

<li>Type in the new dictionary sizes and click 'OK'.<br><br>
    The dictionary sizes you enter into the &quot; Win32Forth Meta Compiler&quot; dialog,
    need to include the size of Win32Forth's base dictionaries. Add 200,000 to the
    desired number of available dictionary bytes for both Application and System dictionaries.<br><br>
    When you have completed these operations, you will have created a modified version of
    Win32Forth with the new dictionary sizes.<br><br></li>

<li>Double click &quot;Win32Forth&quot; to run with the new dictionary sizes.<br><br>
    You can type <code>.FREE</code> into the Win32Forth console window to see the new
    sizes of the dictionaries.</li>
</ol>
