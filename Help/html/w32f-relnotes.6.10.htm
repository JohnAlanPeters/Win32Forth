<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><b>Back to SourceForge! </b>We're grateful to Ron Aaron, who
provided us with a bug tracking system and a full CVS for a considerable
period. Unfortunately, due to several successful hacking attempts on the
CVSTrak bug tracker, and because of the risk to the CVS source, a decision was
made to return to SF for CVS use for the forseeable future. We're grateful to
Ron for his efforts to keep the show on the road. We're disappointed that a
single lone script-kiddy could cause so much damage to our project. The hacking
attempts and the move to SF caused us to loose several months worth of change
log, so the code committed to the SF CVS is missing detailed change information
from October 16, 2003 (version 6.08.00) to December 21, 2004 (base commit to
SF). As a result, the changes documented here are considerably less detailed
than we would wish. Our little experiment in truly open open-source has ended;
SF is more secure, but more difficult to use, and not as open as we would like.</p>

<h2>System Changes</h2>

<p>6.10 is a significant
update from 6.08, but the basic philosophy of ANS Forth compliance and trying
to support as much legacy version 4.2 code as possible is still our primary
goal. </p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The documentation has been
beefed up considerably, and is now almost all HTML based. </p>

<p>Professor <a href="http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/~jvn/">Julian V. Noble</a>
<img border=0 width=16 height=16 src=ONWEB.gif> has kindly allowed us to distribute his
<a href="Guides/primer_Noble.htm">&quot;A Beginner's Guide to Forth&quot;</a> and
some of his formula translation source code.
<a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/home.html">Anton Ertl</a>
<img border=0 width=16 height=16 src=ONWEB.gif> has given his permission to modify the
<a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html">documentation for gforth</a>
<img border=0 width=16 height=16 src=ONWEB.gif> under
the GNU Free Documentation License; work is currently underway on it. We are
grateful to them and other contributors.</p>

<p>Help messages now more closely conform to ANS standard; the help system can be loaded
with the word <code>help-system</code>.</p>



<h3>Native executables</h3>

<p>Win32Forth now produces
native executables (.EXEs) for Windows. The original system of using a wrapper
that provided console facilities and loaded a relocatable image has been
changed in favour of a native executable and a set of supporting DLLs (still
written in C) that provide the console. The effect of this change is to make
Win32Forth a class 1 Forth (a definition of Forth addressing mechanisms
developed by <a href="http://www.forth.org.ru/~mlg/">Michael L Gassanenko </a>
<img border=0 width=16 height=16 src=ONWEB.gif>); effectively, <b>all</b> addresses in
Win32forth are absolute, and the return stack and other address based variables
and values are real addresses, not relative addresses. </p>

<p>This means that <code>rel&gt;abs</code> and <code>abs&gt;rel</code> are no longer
required. The advantages are significant;</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li >Win32Forth is up to 30% faster</li>
 <li >Words that uses addresses (such as calls to Windows) no longer need to be aware
      of them and deal with them differently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, there are no end-user changes required; <code>FSAVE</code> ,
<code>TURNKEY</code> and <code>APPLICATION</code> work without change.</p>



<h3>True Windows multi-tasking support</h3>

<p>Support is provided for
multiple threads of execution in Win32Forth. Many changes have been made to the
internals to make end-user words thread safe without requiring end user code
changes to support it. Currently, how to invoke words as threads is poorly
documented.</p>

<h3>Assembler changes</h3>

<p>Specifically, <b>for
Win32Forth only</b>, the assembler is now issued under the LGPL, not the GPL.
Several small changes have been made; </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>correction for &lt;0 [ebp] [reg]&gt; compiling incorrectly</li>
 <li>addition of [word] and [dword] to support indirect jumps through absolute addresses</li>
 <li>support for CMOVcc and SETcc opcodes</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<p>A large number of bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p>The bug in <b>\</b> which
was causing the stack check warnings to try to print 4,000,000 spaces if the
line has a comment has been fixed..</p>

<p><code>REPRESENT</code>has been modified so zero is output
as 0.0e0 by <code>FS.</code> </p>

<p><code>SYNONYM</code> now leaves the new name as hidden if
the old name isn't found. Also it correctly finds an earlier version of old
name (if it's in the search order) where the two names are the same and the
current and context vocabularies are also the same. </p>

<p><code>LOCALS-INIT</code> has been modified not to throw an
error when used in control structures, since this was causing problems when
values where placed on the stack by the program, while compiling. </p>

<h2>New Applications</h2>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>SciEdit (Win32Forth Source-Editor)</li>
 <li>ForthProject (Win32Forth Project Manager)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Demos</h2>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>HtmlDisplay.f - Display HTML pages in a Window</li>
 <li>MDIExample.f - Example of an MDI application</li>
 <li>MDIDialogExample.f - Example of an MDI application using the MDIDialogWindow Class</li>
 <li>MultiHello.f - Example of using Dialog windows in different threads</li>
</ul>
