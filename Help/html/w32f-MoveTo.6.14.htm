<h1>How to convert code <br> from version 6.12.00 to 6.14.00</h1>

<p>Alhought we do understand that upgrading code is boring some changes cannot be
avoided if we want to improve Win32Forth. This page explains how to convert your
6.12.00 sources to the 6.14.00 Win32Forth version. We apologize for any
inconvenience and hope that you will be satisfied with the new version and its
new features.</p>

<p>Depending on the changes involved, upgrading is more or less difficult. The
steepest changes make your old code not running at all. You will have to do
any needed conversion immediately. Light changes usually are words being
declared "DEPRECATED". They keep your code running but you are strongly encouraged
to make conversions as soon as possible because these words will simply have
disappeared in the next version.</p>

<p>Here is the list of the changes, in decreasing priority order,  follow the links
to get instructions on how to convert :</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Steep change </b><a href='#savewords'>Saving programs</a></li>
  <li><b>Steep change </b><a href='#w32fmsg'>Win32Forth messaging</a></li>
  <li><b>Soft change </b><a href='#deprecated'>Deprecated words</a></li>
</ul>



<a name='savewords'><h3>Saving programs</h3></a>

<p>The words <code>APPLICATION</code> and <code>FSAVE</code> have been removed
and replaced by the word <code>SAVE</code> . The word <code>TURNKEY</code> is
still here but its behaviour has slightly changed.</p>

<p>Behind these changes are two ideas : avoid the need of setting defers
before a save, particularly <code>DEFAULT-HELLO</code> which is too close to
the sytem and easily handle the inclusion of a console and/or message loop
in the saved program.</p>

<p>You can have further details about new <code>SAVE</code> and
<code>TURNKEY</code> words in the help topic
<a href='w32f-imageman.htm'>"Save / Turnkey"</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a procedure for converting : </p>

<p>Suppress any redirection of the defers BOOT , DEFAULT-HELLO and
DEFAULT-APPLICATION .</p>

<p>If you had any application specific initializations in your own definitions
for BOOT or DEFAULT-HELLO , move them in your program's main word.  Delete the
words you were using as BOOT and DEFAULT-HELLO .</p>

<p>Use the cfa of the word you previously put in DEFAULT-APPLICATION as the app-cfa
for either SAVE or TURNKEY .</p>

<p>Suppress any use of <code>MessageLoop</code> (and words that you could get
undefined such as <code>NoConsole></code>) in your program.</p>

<p><br>Then :<br></p>

<p>Replace FSAVE and APPLICATION with SAVE : don't forget to give your program's
main word as the application cfa of SAVE . <br>(TURNKEY remains the same)</p>

<p><br>Then :<br></p>

<p>If you were turnkeying a pure window application (no use of Forth i/o) then
remove any reference to :</p>
<pre>     NoConsole NoConsoleInImage</pre>
<p>and remove from your program's main word:</p>
<pre>     Turnkeyed? if MessageLoop Bye then</pre>


<p>If you were turnkeying a console application prepend :</p>
<pre>     ConsoleBoot</pre>
<p>before your turnkey command.</p>


<p>If your APPLICATION or TURNKEY used a customized forth console, prepend :</p>
<pre>     ConsoleHiddenBoot</pre>
<p>before your SAVE or TURNKEY command and do whatever further console
initialization in your program's main word.</p>


<p>All other cases should need no more conversion.</p>





<a name='w32fmsg'><h3>Win32Forth messaging</h3></a>

<p>This feature is mainly used internally, by the Win32Forth system. You
probably didn't use it and so you don't have to convert anything, nor
read the following paragraph.</p>

<p>However, for the case somebody did use it, here is what is going on : all
the inter-process communication (by win32forth specific messages) and launching
a process by another has been rewritten. The main result is that all messages
between processes are now handled by WM_COPYDATA . The method
<code>WIN32FORTH:</code> has been removed. Knowing that the new console is now
a window like any other one, and hence has its own message loop (ie no longer
uses w32fconsole.dll), the win32forth message chain for handling messages
sent to the console as been removed too. To convert your sources, you will have
to read the Help topic <a href='dexh-w32fmsg.htm'>"win32forth messaging"</a>
and the source src\w32fmsg.f .</p>



<a name='deprecated'><h3>Deprecated words</h3></a>

<p>The use of words that have been deprectaed will emit a loud warning message.
Your application can still run but you should follow the instructions given by
the warning, that is look at the file src\compat\evolve.f which contains very
simple instructions to remove the deprecated word from your source. Usually, this
can be done by a simple search and replace, so don't hesitate to do the work, as
you know that these words will not be in the future Win32Forth release.</p>
