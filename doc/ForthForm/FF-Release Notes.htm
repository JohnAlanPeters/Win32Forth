<center><b><h1>Important Release Notes for ForthForm Ver 2.02.08</h1></b></center>
<center><b>Some things to keep in mind</b></center><br><br>

 <b>1.</b> The toolbar design tool has been significantly enhanced.  Any previous toolbar definition
    files (.tdf) are not compatible with this version. Any attempts to open such will fail.<br><br>

 <b>2.</b> The controls contained in file ExControls.f have been separated into their respective files.
   In addition some not normally used by ForthForm are now not loaded by default. This allows
   the editing of forms to load only those controls needed by an application. Following is the breakdown
   of the files loaded by ExControls.f -
   <pre>
   StatusBar.f	    \ statusbar class
   Textbox.f        \ textbox, passwordbox, multilinetextbox etc.
   Listbox.f        \ listbox, combobox etc.
   UpDownControl.f  \ updowncontrol, spinnercontrol
   Buttons.f        \ checkbox, radiobutton, pushbutton,groupbox
   Label.f          \ label, image labels etc.
   ProgressBar.f    \ not loaded by default
   TrackBar.f       \ ditto
   ScrollBar.f      \ horizontal and vertical scrollbars
   Calendar.f       \ calendar, date/time picker, not loaded by default
   TabControl.f     \ tabcontrol
   ButtonBar.f      \ not loaded by default</pre>

 <b>3.</b> For modal forms an ivar named "parent" was used for the parent handle of the form. This ivar's name has been
 changed to hwndParent. In addition the methods SetParent: and ParentWindow: has been deprecated. Use instead
 SetParentWindow: and GetParentWindow: respectively. Any code or forms that used these names will have to be modified
 or recompiled to continue working.<br><br>
