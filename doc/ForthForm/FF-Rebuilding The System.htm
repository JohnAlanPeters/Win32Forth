<h1 align="center">Rebuilding ForthForm</h1>
Full source code is available with the distribution of ForthForm. This means that
it can be easily extended and regenerated. To build a turnkey system a dummy word
"sysgen" must be defined. This word is already part of the code (somewhere
around line 7 in file ForthForm.f, the main load file) so that the system comes
ready for regeneration. For test purposes this word can be commented out and the
file floaded into the Win32Forth system. When ready to turnkey simply uncomment the
same line and rebuild. It is advisable to do this from a fresh Win32Forth instance.
Use the "Setup.exe" file included with the Win32Forth distribution.

<p>The word "ff" is the word to type at the console if testing the system (note that
the design window will be dispayed automatically if not turnkeying the system). This
will start ForthForm and make the full system available. On exit it will return
to the console.</p>

<p>Another dummy word that may be of interest is "withbgnd" (without quotes).
This word allows a compilation with background image support. For this to be effective
the FreeImage.dll (included with Win32Forth distribution) must be available, either in the same directory as the executable
or in the Windows system directory. This DLL can also be obtained from
<a href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.</p>

All files necessary for a successful rebuild are included with the distribution. Run the "setup.exe" program
in the installed directory and select "Rebuild ForthForm" from the options available.<br><br>

<p>Anyone is free to modify or enhance ForthForm. It is hoped that if they do they would share
any such enhancements so that all may benefit.
