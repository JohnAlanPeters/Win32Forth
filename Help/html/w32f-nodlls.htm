<h1>No DLLs</h1>

<h2>Can't create DLLs with Win32Forth</h2>

<p>At the moment, it is not possible to create DLLs with Win32Forth. This has been
possible in previous versions, before the Win32Forth load address has been made
static (reasons were : speed, image creation, long relocation times...).</p>

<p>The future ITC version, still under development, should permit to offer this
functionality again.
