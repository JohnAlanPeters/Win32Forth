<h1>Chains and how to use them</h1>

<p>Chains are used to perform
a number of words sequentially. Unlike a normal colon definition you can add
tasks, either to the end, or the beginning, thus making them suitable for
things like initialization or de-initialization, where you want to add extra
words to the chain, depending on which files a particular application needs.</p>

<p>Two words are provided to
extend chains, <code>CHAIN-ADD</code> and <code>CHAIN-ADD-BEFORE</code>. The former is for forward chains,
like initialization chains, where the word is added to the end of the chain,
while the latter is for backward chains such as de-initialization chains, where
the word is added to the beginning of the chain, so that things are undone in
reverse order.</p>


<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p><code>.CHAIN        ( chain-addr -- ) \ system word</code><br>
Print out the words that have been added to chain, in the order that they will be
executed by DO-CHAIN. The output is printed using tabbing and capitalization to
make the lines stand out. </p>

<p><code>.CHAINS       ( -- ) \ system word</code><br>
Print out all the chains in the application area and their contents. Each chain name is
printed in capitals on a new line and then the contents are printed as per
.CHAIN </p>

<p><code>?SYS-CHAIN    ( chain_addr xt -- chain_addr xt )</code><br>
Issue a warning if xt is in system space and is being added to a chain that is in
application space, and we are not transienting. Warnings are suppressed if
sys-warning? is off.</p>

<p><code>CHAIN-ADD     ( chain_addr &lt;word-to-add&gt; -- )</code><br>
Add xt of &lt;word-to-add&gt; to the end of chain whose address is chain_addr so that it
is executed after previously added words in the chain.</p>

<p><code>CHAIN-ADD-BEFORE ( chain_addr &lt;word-to-add&gt; -- )</code><br>
Add xt of &lt;word-to-add&gt; to the start of chain whose address is chain_addr so that
it is executed before previously added words in the chain. This is mainly used
for de-initializing, so that initialization that is done last is de-initialized
first. </p>

<p><code>CHAIN-LINK    ( -- addr )</code><br>
Variable pointing to the link of the first chain in the list of chains in the application
area (or containing Null if no chains exist). Used by .CHAINS and for
forgetting.</p>

<p><code>DO-CHAIN      ( i*x chain_addr -- j*x )</code><br>
Execute sequentially all the words of the chain whose address is on the stack, passing i*x
to the first word and any output down the chain, returning j*x from the last
word.</p>

<p><code>NEW-CHAIN     ( &lt;name&gt; -- )</code><br>
Create a new chain &lt;name&gt; in the application area.If currently compiling in the
system area throw an abort. The chain is linked into the list of chains printed
out by .CHAINS and any words added to the chain are trimmed when they are in a
forgotten part of the dictionary. </p>

<p><code>NOOP-CHAIN-ADD  ( chain_addr -- addr )</code><br>
Add xt of NOOP to the end of chain whose address is chain_addr and return the address of
the cell containing it. </p>

<p><code>TRANSIENT-PTR   ( -- f )</code><br>
Value containing true if transienting.</p>

<p><code>SYS-NEW-CHAIN   ( &lt;name&gt; -- )</code><br>
Create a new chain &lt;name&gt; in the system area.If currently compiling in the
application area throw an abort. The chain is not linked into the list of
chains printed out by .CHAINS and any words added to the chain are not trimmed
when they are in a forgotten part of the dictionary. </p>


<h2>Obsolete words</h2>

<p>XDO-CHAIN (in the FORTH
vocabulary ) and EXIT-DO-CHAIN ( in the HIDDEN vocabulary ) were in ealier
versions of WIN32FORTH and have since been depreciated. Use <span
class=SpellE>DO-CHAIN <span class=SpellE>instead.</p>

<h2>Predefined chains in Win32Forth</h2>

<p>Win32Forth is using the following predefined chains: </p>
