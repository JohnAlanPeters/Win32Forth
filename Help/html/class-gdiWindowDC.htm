<h1>gdiWindowDc -- Window device context class
</h1><h3><i>Version 1.0
</i></h3><p>This GDI class library was written and placed in the Public Domain
in 2005 by Dirk Busch
</p><h2>Glossary
</h2><p><b><code>:class gdiWindowDC &lt;super gdiDC
</code></b><br>Window device context class
</p><p><b><code>:M Release: ( -- )
</code></b><br>The Release: method releases a device context (DC), freeing it
for use by other applications. The effect of the ReleaseDC function depends
on the type of DC. It frees only common and window DCs. It has no effect on
class or private DCs.
</p><p><b><code>:M GetDC: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( hWnd -- f )
</code></b><br>The GetDC method retrieves a handle to a display device context
for the client area of a specified window.
</p><p><b><code>:M GetDCEx: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( hrgnClip flags hWnd -- f )
</code></b><br>The GetDCEx method &nbsp;retrieves a handle to a display device context
for the client area of a specified window or for the entire screen.
You can use the returned handle in subsequent GDI functions to draw in the DC.
</p><p>This function is an extension to the GetDC function, which gives an application
more control over how and whether clipping occurs in the client area.
</p><p><i>&nbsp;hrgnClip </i>&nbsp;Specifies a clipping region that may be combined with the visible region
of the DC. If the value of flags is DCX_INTERSECTRGN or DCX_EXCLUDERGN, then the
operating system assumes ownership of the region and will automatically delete it
when it is no longer needed. In this case, applications should not use the region
not even delete it after a successful call to GetDCEx.
</p><p><i>&nbsp;flags </i>&nbsp;Specifies how the DC is created. This parameter can be one or more of the
following values.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_WINDOW </b>&nbsp;Returns a DC that corresponds to the window rectangle rather
than the client rectangle.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_CACHE </b>&nbsp;Returns a DC from the cache, rather than the OWNDC or CLASSDC
window. Essentially overrides CS_OWNDC and CS_CLASSDC.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_PARENTCLIP </b>&nbsp;Uses the visible region of the parent window. The parent's
WS_CLIPCHILDREN and CS_PARENTDC style bits are ignored. The
origin is set to the upper-left corner of the window identified
by hWnd.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_CLIPSIBLINGS </b>&nbsp;Excludes the visible regions of all sibling windows above the
window identified by hWnd.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_CLIPCHILDREN </b>&nbsp;Excludes the visible regions of all child windows below the
window identified by hWnd.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_NORESETATTRS </b>&nbsp;Does not reset the attributes of this DC to the default attributes
when this DC is released.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_LOCKWINDOWUPDATE </b>&nbsp;Allows drawing even if there is a LockWindowUpdate call in effect
that would otherwise exclude this window. Used for drawing during
tracking.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_EXCLUDERGN </b>&nbsp;The clipping region identified by hrgnClip is excluded from the
visible region of the returned DC.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_INTERSECTRGN </b>&nbsp;The clipping region identified by hrgnClip is intersected with the
visible region of the returned DC.
</p><p><b>&nbsp;DCX_VALIDATE </b>&nbsp;When specified with DCX_INTERSECTUPDATE, causes the DC to be
completely validated. Using this function with both DCX_INTERSECTUPDATE
and DCX_VALIDATE is identical to using the BeginPaint function.
</p><p><b><code>:M GetWindowDC: ( hWnd -- f )
</code></b><br>The GetWindowDC method retrieves the device context (DC) for the entire
window, including title bar, menus, and scroll bars. A window device
context permits painting anywhere in a window, because the origin of
the device context is the upper-left corner of the window instead of
the client area.
</p><p><b><code>:M GetDCOrg: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( -- x y )
</code></b><br>The GetDCOrgEx function retrieves the final translation origin for a specified device
context (DC). The final translation origin specifies an offset that the system uses to
translate device coordinates into client coordinates (for coordinates in an application's
window).
