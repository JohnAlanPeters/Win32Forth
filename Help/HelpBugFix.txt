             - got the return key in input keystrokes as Ezra suggested

************
*   Todo   *
************


"doc stuff"

- add html doc footer in dexh commented source files and \ $I d: $ in all
- w32f-utils.htm to dispatch
- RESOURCES.TXT and DIALOGRC.TXT
- still some w32f-todo.htm ...


"the functionality problem"

To be put in HelpFct.txt + related html help sheets + retreive comments + upgrade comments
what is the best base to handle this work ?
Once comments upgraded and functionality added in source
     ==> "easy" to generate HelpFct.txt and even html sheets
Probably needs two levels of functionality, maybe three, use HelpSummary for structuration
