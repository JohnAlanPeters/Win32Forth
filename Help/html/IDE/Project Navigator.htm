<h1>Project Navigator</h1>

<br>


<p>While Project Manager keeps track of files in  a project, Navigator complements
it by keeping track of the code in the project. This allows quickly finding where
code is defined in a large multi-file project.</p>

<p>In the IDE Preferences Dialog an option is available to allow or prevent
the inclusion of library files when tracking code in a project. Usually you
will not put this option ON as you are not to edit these sources and as
Help is able to provide any needed information about the win32Forth and
Libraries words.</p>

<p>The root item is the name of the current project. Tracking a project (click the
<b>track</b> button) scans all the files in a project and builds the Navigator tree
from the code. If no project is opened any source files opened in the IDE will
be indexed. Pressing the control key while clicking the track button will
build the tree from opened source files even if a project is opened.</p>

<p>Code is separated into objects and classes, global (i.e not private to a class
or object) definitions, private definitions, methods and data (consisting of
values, variables, ints etc.) Clicking a tree item will expand the list. When
a code item is clicked some useful information, including the source file where it can be found
and the line number is displayed in the status bar.</p>

<p>Navigator also builds a list of references for code words that are found. If an item
is referenced in a project it will have a '+' symbol next to it. Clicking the symbol expands the
item to show what words reference it.</p>

<p>The <b>Goto</b> button will open the source file and position the cursor at the
line number where the code is located. If the control key is pressed while the Goto button
 is clicked it will enable auto mode. This allows single-clicking of an item
 in the Navigator to open its source file.</p>

<p>Note that in the methods/private definitions/private data tree the item in
brackets is the parent class/object of the method/definition/data.</p>
