anew w_search.f  \ October 7th, 2002  By J.v.d.Ven.

\ July 27th, 2002
\ Corrected a number of bugs. Now w-search returns the found string.

\ May 23rd, 2003
\ - Made w-search case insensitive

\ July 7th, 2003
\ - Made this source independed from toolset.f
\ - added an extra flag to w-search. The flag determines if the search
\   is case insensitive or not.
\ - *search puts a * before the specification string.
\ - Then it performs a w-search

\ July 21st, 2003
\ - Changed w_search. Now it will return the stack right when a search
\   buffer or a specification string has a lenght of 0.

\ February 21st, 2007
\  - Added "SetToForeground

\ February 21st, 2013
\  - Improved +training

\  From toolset.f \ load it here when you would like to use it.

\ s-exchange to prevent roll when posible

code s-exchange ( ... n[k]..0 k -- ... 0..n[k] )
                mov  eax, ebx               \ save k
                mov  ecx, [esp]             \ save nos

                mov  0 [esp] [eax*4] , ecx  \ put nos where n[k] was
                pop eax           \ discard second item on data stack
                next    c;

\ Usage:
\ 10 20 30 40   3  cr .s  s-exchange    cr .s
\ result:
\ [5] 10 20 30 40 3

\ Initially Made by Ron Aaron.
\ COMPAREI is the same as COMPARE , but case-insensitive
\ Modifications to get a better shell-sort:
\ 1. The version leaves the chars from 0 to 2F unchanged.
\    The effect is that in a sort the non-alphanumeric characters will not be
\    between the alphanumeric characters.
\ 2. It uses jnb instead of jns which makes sure that the character FF is at
\    the end of a sorted list.
\ 3. Changed the name to COMPAREIA to avoid future conflicts.
