<h1>Some generalities</h1>

<h2>Case-sensivity</h2>

<p>Win32Forth is case
insensitive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>There is one important exception however, it is for Windows procedures calls where you have
to strictly follow Windows spelling : eg you have to type : </p>

<p><code>LoadLibrary GetProcAddress</code> etc.</p>



<h2>Forth comments</h2>

<p>Forth traditional comments are in the form : </p>

<p><code>\       </code>comment until end of line</p>
<p><code>(       </code>comment until <code>)</code> is encountered (this can be a multiline comment)</p>

<p>It is sometimes useful to have other sets of comments (to transiently comment in or out some
pieces of code while debugging for instance). Win32Forth offers two additionnal multiline
comments : </p>

<p><code>((       </code>comment until <code>))</code> is encountered </p>
<p><code>COMMENT: </code>comment until <code>COMMENT;</code> is encountered </p>

<p>There is also a word to comment until end of source file : </p>

<p><code>\S      </code>comment until end of file</p>
