<h1>Using -IF</h1>

<p>Traditionally Forth uses IF
to execute conditional code, however there are times when the value or flag
that is being tested is needed later. Of course one can simply DUP it for later
use, but that involves adding an extra XT ( one CELL ) to the code, plus an extra
instruction to execute: -IF is a non-destructive version of IF that overcomes
this problem since it preserves the value being tested without adding an extra
instruction ( in fact since IF executes code to drop the value -IF is slightly
faster ). The most obvious use of -IF is eliminating a DUP preceding an IF,
however there are other situations where it can provide more optimal code:</p>

<p>1)  ?DUP IF can be replaced by -IF where there is an ELSE part like so: </p>

<pre>    ... ?DUP IF ... ELSE ... THEN ... </pre>

<p>as</p>

<pre>    ... -IF ... ELSE DROP ... THEN ... </pre>

<p>which is faster ( especially for TRUE ) and which can allow further optimization if the
DROP can be incorporated into the following code ( since it's always FALSE (
i.e. 0 ) we may be able to use it ) </p>

<p>2)  When the ELSE part of a conditional serves
     only to put FALSE on the stack and the drop can be incorporated into the
     following code as in: </li>
</ol>

<pre>    : IsWinConstant ( str -- str FALSE | val TRUE )
                     { \ WinVal }
                     &LOCAL WinVal over
                     count swap Call wcFindWin32Constant
                     if      drop
                             WinVal TRUE
                     else    FALSE
                     then    ;</pre>

<p>then </p>

<pre>    : IsWinConstant ( str -- str FALSE | val TRUE )
                    { \ WinVal -- }
                    &LOCAL WinVal over
                    count swap Call wcFindWin32Constant
                    -if     2drop
                            WinVal TRUE
                    then    ;</pre>

<p>is both shorter ( 3 CELLS ) and faster ( especially when the condition
is FALSE ) </p>
