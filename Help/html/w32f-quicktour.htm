<h1>Win32Forth quick tour</h1>

<p> Win32Forth is a huge
source. Althought it is likely that the following information will be obsolete
even before it is finished, it may be useful to get a general view of the beast : </p>

<p> You have to know
that Win32Forth is delivered with full source. Most of the source is
interesting from the user point of view but some parts that are needed by the
system may not be of great interest for him. Here is a quick description of all
directories in Win32Forth, showing what is worth to explore. </p>

<h3>Directory Apps</h3>

<p> Contains a collection of
Win32Forth full applications : </p>

<p> Some are part of the system
(Win32ForthIDE : the integrated development
environment, incorparating the form designer( formally ForthForm), the Project Manager and Editor (formally SciMDIEdit and SciEdit), some are true applications or games (PictureViewer, Solipion,
etc.) </p>

<p> You can also find here the
source for the old Win32Forth editor : WinEd. </p>

<p> Once you are developping
complex applications, these files will provide many examples of
&quot;complicated&quot; use of Win32Forth, but this is not the best place to
start. </p>

<h3>Directory Proj </h3>

<p> Here are stored the project
files for the above applications. You shouldn't use much this directory (unless
for storing your own projects) </p>

<h3> Directory Demos </h3>

<p> This is the best place to
start playing with Win32Forth. This directory contains simple, although fully
functional examples of use. </p>

<h3> Directory ExtSrc </h3>

<p> This directory may be
absent, depending on the setup options you used. It mainly contains C source
for the last dll files that are not yet written in Forth and some other tools.
You can forget it. </p>

<h3> Directory Help and/or Doc </h3>

<p> This directory contains all
the help stuff, including html pages and the help program itself. Its internals
are not of great interest (unless you want to provide a similar help system for
your own application) </p>

<h3> Directory Templates </h3>

<p> Seems to be shorter as possible templates for your own code... </p>

<h3> Directory Scr </h3>

<p> This is the heart of
Win32Forth. Console, Gdi, Kernel and the Src files thelselves are used to build
the Win32Forth executable. </p>

<p> Of special interest are the Lib and Tools subdirs. The first one is a library
containing a number of optionally loadable classes and options. You have to use
the directive <code>NEEDS afile.f</code> to load the parts your application needs in.
The Tools subdir is a bit the same but for transiently used tools. </p>

<p> When we say &quot;explore
Win32Forth&quot;, we essentially mean &quot;explore Src&quot;. There you can
understand in depth every feature of Win32Forth (and we promise you will learn
a lot !) </p>

<h3> Directory Win32Forth </h3>

<p> This is the
&quot;installation directory&quot;. Besides all previous subdirs, it contains
mainly executables, config files and dlls.  </p>

<p> Most of the dlls are required to run Win32Forth (in Console and / or IDE mode) </p>

<ul>
 <li>w32FConsole.dll   was used by Console in older versions, but has been replaced by a new console written in forth. </li>
 <li>w32fScintilla.dll   is used by the SciEdit editor (and then by the IDE)</li>
 <li>Zip32.dll   is used by the IDE and Project Manager </li>
 <li>WinCon.dll   contains all the Windows constants </li>
</ul>

<p> If you want to use
Win32Forth in another directory than where it was installed, you will have to
bring these dlls and the config files with it. </p>

<p> They are ways to get rid of
these dlls once you have made an application <code>TURNKEY</code> (a TUNRNKEYed application
is an application running on its own, with no longer available Forth
interpreter) </p>

<p> (Each time you get bored of
exploring, just click on an exe of any application. They are also stored in
this directory) </p>
